=============================

Samsung Galaxy Xcover GT-S5690

Incomplete!

* Recovery working pretty well, able to backup,restore and install zips. Had to remove couple apps and background image to fit it into recovery partition.
* Boots to the home screen without errors.
* Touchscreen works.
* Problems with the RIL. Very near to get it to work though.
* Haven't tried camera etc. yet. Also no display hardware acceleration.

Any help and contributions appreciated. I'm pretty busy with work and "real life" at the moment.
